Day 4
- Dificulty: Easy
- Description: 
    - part 1: check string for repeated words
    - part 2: check string for anagrams
- Coding Topic(s): regex, string parsing, sets, combinations, anagrams (sorting)
- Notes: i solved part 1 with str.split() and set(). for part 2 i use combinations and sorted lists

Day 10
- Dificulty: Medium
- Description: 
    - part 1: reverse a subset of a list, make sure it wraps around
    - part 2: convert characters to bytes, add a for loop, XOR all to create a better hashing function
- Coding Topic(s): list/array indexing, slicing, reversing, modulo, ascii, XOR, for loops
- Notes: it took me way too long to get part 1, not because it was hard, but because I was trying to remember the most efficient slicing methods. part 2 was a bit tedious but not crazy. interesting to learn a bit more about hashing 

Day 16
- Dificulty: Hard/Challenge
- Description: part 1 is a simple list shuffling game but part 2 is a major scalability challenge that I haven't figured out
- Coding Topic(s): indexing, find index of a value in a list/string, scalability
- Notes:
